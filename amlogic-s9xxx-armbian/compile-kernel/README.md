# Kernel Compilation and Usage Instructions

View Chinese description | [æŸ¥çœ‹ä¸­æ–‡è¯´æ˜Ž](README.cn.md)

This kernel can be used for `Armbian` and `OpenWrt` systems. For example, it can be used in the [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian), [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt), [flippy-openwrt-actions](https://github.com/ophub/flippy-openwrt-actions), and [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) projects. It can be integrated when compiling firmware or installed to use in an existing system.

You can adjust the kernel's configuration as needed, such as adding drivers and patches. You can also compile personalized signature kernels with special significance according to your mood, such as `5.10.95-happy-new-year`, `5.10.96-beijing-winter-olympics`, `5.10.99-valentines-day`, and so on.

## Kernel Repository

Pre-compiled kernels are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases) of [ophub/kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel).

## Local Compilation

- ### Running on Ubuntu system

1. Clone the repository to local `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian.git`

2. Install necessary software packages (the script has only been tested under x86_64 Ubuntu-20.04/22.04)

```yaml
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
# For Ubuntu-22.04
sudo apt-get install -y $(cat compile-kernel/tools/script/ubuntu2204-build-armbian-depends)
```

3. Go to the `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian` root directory, and then run `sudo ./recompile -k 5.15.100` or other specified parameter commands to compile the kernel. The script will automatically download and install the compilation environment and kernel source code, and make all settings. The packaged kernel files are saved in the `compile-kernel/output` directory.


- ### Running on the Armbian system

1. Update local compilation environment and configuration files: `armbian-kernel -u`

2. Compile the kernel: Run `armbian-kernel -k 5.15.100` or other specified parameter commands to compile the kernel. The script will automatically download, install the compilation environment and the kernel source code, and make all settings. The packaged kernel files are saved in the `/opt/kernel/compile-kernel/output` directory.

- ### Local Compilation Parameter Explanation

| Parameter | Meaning      | Description |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| -r        | Repository  | Specifies the source code repository for compiling the kernel. You can choose the kernel source code repository from `github.com`, such as `-r unifreq`. The parameter format can be a combination of three items `owner/repo@branch`. The owner's name `owner` is a mandatory parameter, the kernel source code repository name `/repo` and the branch name of the repository `@branch` are optional parameters. When only specifying the owner's name `owner`, it will automatically match the kernel source code repository with the name format `linux-5.x.y` and the branch `main` of the owner. If the repository name or branch name is different, please specify it in combination, such as `owner@branch` or `owner/repo` or `owner/repo@branch`. Default value: `unifreq` |
| -k        | Kernel      | Specifies the kernel name, such as `-k 5.15.100`. Multiple kernels are connected with `_`, such as `-k 5.15.100_5.15.50` |
| -a        | AutoKernel  | Sets whether to automatically adopt the latest version of the same series of kernels. When it is `true`, it will automatically search whether there is a newer version of the same series of kernels specified in `-k`, such as `5.15.100`. If there is a latest version after `5.15.100`, it will automatically switch to the latest version. When set to `false`, it will compile the specified version of the kernel. Default value: `true` |
| -m        | MakePackage | Sets the package list for making the kernel. When set to `all`, it will make all the files of `Image, modules, dtbs`. When the setting value is `dtbs`, only 3 dtbs files will be produced. Default value: `all` |
| -p        | AutoPatch   | Sets whether to use custom kernel patches. When set to `true`, it will use the kernel patches in the [tools/patch](tools/patch) directory. For detailed instructions, refer to [how to add kernel patches](../documents/README.md#9-compiling-armbian-kernel). Default value: `false` |
| -n        | CustomName  | Sets the custom signature of the kernel. When set to `-ophub`, the generated kernel name is `5.15.100-ophub`. Please do not include spaces when setting custom signatures. Default value: `-ophub` |
| -t        | Toolchain   | Sets the toolchain for compiling the kernel. Options: `clang / gcc`. Default value: `gcc` |

- `sudo ./recompile`: Compile the kernel using the default configuration.
- `sudo ./recompile -k 5.15.100`: Use the default configuration and specify the kernel version to be compiled through `-k`. Multiple versions are connected using `_` for simultaneous compilation.
- `sudo ./recompile -k 5.15.100 -a true`: Use the default configuration and set whether to automatically upgrade to the latest kernel of the same series during kernel compilation through the `-a` parameter.
- `sudo ./recompile -k 5.15.100 -n -ophub`: Use the default configuration and set the kernel custom signature through the `-n` parameter.
- `sudo ./recompile -k 5.15.100 -m dtbs`: Use the default configuration and specify only the creation of dtbs files through the `-m` parameter.
- `sudo ./recompile -k 5.15.100_6.1.10 -a true -n -ophub`: Use the default configuration and set multiple parameters.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: We recommend using the kernel source code from repositories such as [linux-6.1.y](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-6.1.y), [linux-5.15.y](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.15.y), [linux-5.10.y](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.10.y) and [linux-5.4.y](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.4.y) of `unifreq` for compilation, who added drivers and patches for related boxes. It is recommended to use the template in [tools/config](tools/config), which has been pre-configured according to the related boxes and can be customized based on this.

## Compile Kernel Using GitHub Actions

1. In the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page, select ***`Compile the kernel`*** and click the ***`Run workflow`*** button to compile.

2. See the use of the template [compile-kernel.yml](../.github/workflows/compile-kernel.yml). The code is as follows:

```yaml
- name: Compile the kernel
  uses: ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian@main
  with:
    build_target: kernel
    kernel_version: 5.15.1_6.1.1
    kernel_auto: true
    kernel_sign: -yourname
```

ðŸ’¡ Note: If you `fork` the repository and made modifications, you need to change the Actions `username` to your own repository when using it, and according to the instructions in items 2-3, [Add TOKEN](../documents/README.md#2-set-up-private-variable-github_token), for example:

```yaml
uses: YOUR-REPO/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian@main
```
