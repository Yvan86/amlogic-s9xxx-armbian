The [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/) system is a lightweight Linux system based on Debian/Ubuntu built specifically for ARM chips. The Armbian system is lean, clean, and 100% compatible and inherits the functions and rich software ecosystem of the Debian/Ubuntu system. It can run safely and stably in TF/SD/USB and the eMMC of the device.

Now you can replace the Android TV system of the TV box with the Armbian system, making it a powerful server. This project builds Armbian system for `Amlogic`, `Rockchip` and `Allwinner` boxes. including install to eMMC and update kernel related functions. Please refer to the [Armbian Documentation](./build-armbian/documents) for the usage method.

The latest version of the Armbian system can be downloaded in [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/releases). Welcome to `Fork` and personalize it. If it is useful to you, you can click on the `Star` in the upper right corner of the repository to show your support.

New compilation: Select ***`Build armbian`*** on the [Actions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page, According to the OS version officially supported by Armbian, you can choose Ubuntu series: `jammy`, or Debian series: `bullseye`, etc., Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button. More parameter setting methods can be found in [the official document of Armbian](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Options/).

3. Compile again: If there is an `Armbian_.*-trunk_.*.img.gz` file in [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/releases), you do not need to compile it completely, you can directly use this file to `build amlogic armbian` of different board. Select ***`Use Releases file to build armbian`*** on the [Actions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.

4. Use other Armbian system, such as [odroidn2](https://armbian.tnahosting.net/dl/odroidn2/archive/) provided by the official Armbian system download site [armbian.tnahosting.net](https://armbian.tnahosting.net/dl/), only by introducing the script of this repository in the process control file [rebuild-armbian.yml](.github/workflows/rebuild-armbian.yml) for Armbian reconstruction, it can be adapted to the use of other TV Boxes. In the [Actions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page, select ***`Rebuild armbian`***, and enter the Armbian network download url such as `https://dl.armbian.com/*/Armbian_*.img.xz`, or in the process control file [rebuild-armbian.yml](.github/workflows/rebuild-armbian.yml), set the load path of the rebuild file through the `armbian_path` parameter. code show as below:

```yaml
- name: Rebuild Armbian
  uses: ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian@main
  with:
    build_target: armbian
    armbian_path: build/output/images/*.img
    armbian_board: s905d_s905x3_s922x_s905x
    armbian_kernel: 5.10.125_5.15.50

## Armbian Contributors

First of all, I would like to thank [150balbes](https://github.com/150balbes) for his outstanding contributions and a good foundation for using Armbian in the Amlogic TV Boxes. The [Armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) system compiled here directly uses the latest official source code for real-time compilation. The development idea of the program comes from the tutorials of authors such as [ebkso](https://www.kflyo.com/howto-compile-armbian-for-n1-box). Thank you for your dedication and sharing, so that we can use the Armian system in more boxes.

The `kernel` / `u-boot` and other resources used by this system are mainly copied from the project of [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit), Some files are shared by users in [Pull](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues) of [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt) / [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian) / [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic) / [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel) and other projects. To thank these pioneers and sharers, From now on (This source code repository was created on 2021-09-19), I have recorded them in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md). Thanks again everyone for giving new life and meaning to the TV Boxes.

## Other distributions

- The [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt) project provides the `OpenWrt` system used in the box, which is also applicable to the relevant devices that support Armbian.
- [unifreq](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) has made `OpenWrt` system for more boxes such as `Amlogic`, `Rockchip` and `Allwinner`, which is a benchmark in the box circle and is recommended for use.
- [Scirese](https://github.com/Scirese/alarm) tested the production, installation and use of `Arch Linux ARM` / `Manjaro` system in the Android TV boxes, please refer to the relevant instructions in his repository for details.
- [7Ji](https://7ji.github.io/) published some articles on reverse engineering and development on the Amlogic platform in his blog, such as installing the ArchLinux ARM system in the way of ArchLinux, and introducing the startup mechanism of the Amlogic platform. In his [ampart](https://github.com/7Ji/ampart) project, he provided a partitioning tool that supports reading and editing Amlogic's eMMC partition table and DTB partitions, and can make 100% use of the eMMC space. The method of making and using `Arch Linux ARM` is provided in [amlogic-s9xxx-archlinuxarm](https://github.com/7Ji/amlogic-s9xxx-archlinuxarm) project. Yet Another openvfd Daemon is provided in [YAopenvfD](https://github.com/7Ji/YAopenvfD) project.
